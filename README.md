This is a programming language, I designed for making performance wise code and for fun.

I wanted automatic optimizer and when you call a function sometimes do you wonder how long it will take.
This is what you can get, for example if you have got a JsonTable, this language makes it quite easy to make a OptJsonTable which does the same thing except can't take abstract strings.
If you call 
````c
baked(JsonTable.parse("{\"do\":\"dont\"}\"));
````
then the json will load at compile time. You could make it automatic that it does that.
I like the idea of making a programming language especially an open source one.
That way if anybody dosen't like an aspect of the language the change the source code.
